	<h1>Hi everyone, it's Alice ¯\_༼ ಥ ‿ ಥ ༽_/¯</h1>

	<p>
	I don't really know what to do with my life and it's really fun cause my parents pay 50k for my studies. And right now I'm doing a course about programming while I could end being volcanologist. But as we use to say : one life ! 🤑

	<h2>Writing✍️</h2>
	<p>
	I can't really express myself orally so I write a lot: two books and some personal notebooks. I like word's logic, you make them relate and find them a sense, it's interesting.
	</p>

	<h2>Entrepreneurship🔎</h2>
	<p>
	Undertake, think about strategies, find creative ideas, work together, set up a project... that's what I like about entrepreneurship. It's challenging and attractive.
	</p>

	<h2>Meet people</h2>
	<p>
	I don't know about my future, but I'm sure that my environment will be very diverse, with people from all over the world. I like to discover new traditions and people's route, I think it's very interesting.
